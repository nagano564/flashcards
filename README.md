# Flip Cards App

A simple web application for creating and studying flash cards. This entire application was created using natural language prompts in Windsurf IDE - no manual coding required! The application was built through conversational interactions with Windsurf's AI assistant, demonstrating the power of natural language programming.

## Running the Application

You can run this application using any of these methods:

### Using Python 3 (Recommended)
```bash
# Navigate to the app directory
cd "path/to/flip cards"

# Start the server
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Then open in your browser:
# http://localhost:8000
```

### Using Python 2
```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

### Using Node.js
```bash
# Install http-server globally (one-time setup)
npm install -g http-server

# Start the server
http-server

# Then open the URL shown in the terminal
```

## Features
- Create flash cards manually
- Import cards from JSON files
- Study mode with card flipping
- Click cards or use buttons to flip
- Shuffle cards for randomized study
- Automatic saving to browser storage

## Development

This application was developed entirely using natural language programming in Windsurf IDE. The development process was as simple as:

1. Describing the desired features in plain English
2. Having conversations with Windsurf's AI assistant
3. Iteratively refining the application through natural dialogue

No manual coding was required - all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were generated through natural language interactions. This demonstrates how modern AI tools like Windsurf can transform the way we create software, making programming accessible to everyone.
